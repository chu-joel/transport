# üöç Transport

I often fall asleep on public transport and miss my stop ‚Äî so I built a solution!
As part of a university project, I developed a React Native mobile app that lets users set a destination and receive an alert when they're within a certain distance. No more oversleeping ‚Äî your phone will wake you up just in time! üò¥üìç

The app is built with React Native and hosted on Expo, using Firebase to store system settings that can be updated on the fly.

The only alarm sound is wake me up by avicii which I though was very fitting for this application.

## üîë Key Highlights:

    üìç Google Maps API integration for real-time location tracking

    üåô Fully built in Dark Mode for a sleek look

    üîî Customizable alerts ‚Äî choose vibrate, sound, and the proximity distance

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:

    React Native

    Firestore (Firebase)

    Expo
